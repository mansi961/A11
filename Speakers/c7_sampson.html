    <h2>Scott Sampson: <em>Fossil Threads in the Web of Life</em></h2>
    <p class="highlight">February</p>
    <p><strong>What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage Utahceratops!</strong></p>
    <p>Come to the Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the Utah Museum of Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has focused on the ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs, and he has conducted fieldwork in countries across Africa, as well as in the U.S. and Canada.</p>

    <p>Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist with a Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Toronto. His doctoral work examined two new species of ceratopsids from Montana and explored how their horns and frills developed and functioned.</p>

    <p>After earning his Ph.D., Sampson worked at the American Museum of Natural History in NYC, taught at the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine, and later took a dual role at the University of Utah and the Utah Museum of Natural History. His specialties include phylogenetics, functional morphology, and dinosaur evolution.</p>

    <p>He has led digs in Zimbabwe, South Africa, Madagascar, and across North America. Sampson was the on-air host for <strong>Dinosaur Planet</strong> on the Discovery Channel and authored the widely acclaimed <em>Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life</em>.</p>
